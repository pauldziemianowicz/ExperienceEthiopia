            <p class="first-paragraph">The extreme escarpment of the Simien plateau appears to have originated due to uplift of the entire Ethiopian plateau caused by volcanic activity that originated approximately 75 million years ago.  The The Simien mountains were then formed between 25 and 40 million years ago from lava outpourings during the Oligocene period.  These outpourings resulted in a layer of volcanic rock approximately 3,000-3,500 meters thick.  The outer rim of the large, ancient volcano responsible for these lava outpourings comprise three of the highest peaks in the region: Ras Dejen (4,533m), Bwahit (4,430m) and Silki (4,420m).  Massive erosion of the northern edge of the plateau over millions of years has created one of the most spectacular landscapes in the world, with jagged peaks, deeps ravines, and sharp precipices dropping over 5,000 ft.

            <p class="first-paragraph">The Simien Massif has been traversed as a trade route between Aksum, Lalibela, Mekele, and Gonder for thousands of years.  Some of the earliest settlers of the mountains were the Ethiopian Jews.  Following the decline in the Jewish kingdom in the 14th century, many inhabitants converted to Orthodox Christianity, and still practice this religion today. Inhabitants of the Simien mountains live predominantly by agriculture.  Sheep, goats, and cattle are common. Oxen and horse are also used as beasts of labor.  Other the past few decades, human cultivation of park lands had become a major problem, with a peak of 80% of land occupied by human activity.  Over the past decades, under guidance from UNESCO, the park has made concerted efforts to decrease human impact on parklands.  In some circumstances, this has resulted in realignment of park boundaries to exclude villages and allow for better protection of park resources.  In 2009, 167 households were voluntarily resettled from a village near a critical wildlife corridor to a newly extended park area.  A second voluntary resettlement program was offered to residents of Gich in 2013.

              <img class="section-image right wildlife" ng-src="{{$root.saCDNURL}}About-TSM-Wildlife-Baboons.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="first-paragraph">The Gelada, or “bleeding heart baboon”, is an old-world monkey and not a true baboon despite previous naming conventions. The gelada is found solely in the highlands of Ethiopia and feeds primarily on fresh shoots of grass. The gelada social system consists of a hierarchy of social groupings. A typical reproductive unit consists of 1-4 males with a single breeding alpha male, and 1-10 females with their dependent young. A band consists of 2-10 reproductive units. A band of geladas shares a common foraging and sleeping area, and may also contain 1-3 all male groups (younger, non-breeding males who stay in these groups for 2-4 years before trying to enter a reproductive unit). Females tend to be closely related and stay in their band for all their lives. Ranging bands of gelada can overlap territories, and will occasionally form very large communities, up to 1000 strong. There are an estimated 2,500 Gelada in the park and another 2,000 in the surrounding Simien massif, with average band sizes of 200 individuals. At night time the Gelada bands retreat down onto the cliff faces where they sleep to avoid nocturnal predators. This is an impressive spectacle and can sometimes be seen at Gich camp. If you have the opportunity to spend time at Simien lodge at the beginning of your hike, they have a fantastic 1-hour documentary about the Gelada that is typically played around 5-6PM, just before dinner.

              <p class="first-paragraph">The Walia Ibex is unique to the Simien Mountains National Park. Walia Ibex live on the steep slopes and escarpments in the park, and forage in open areas, usually in groups. Males and females usually forage separately unless mating. Due to restricted range and low population, Walia Ibex are classified as endangered on the IUCN red list, however sightings have increased substantially with continued rehabilitation of their habitat. Population of the Ibex has increased from 200 at the end of the civil war in the early 1990s to over 500 today, mostly in the Chennek and Bwahit areas of the park where they are most likely to be seen.
              </p>
              <p>Other mammalian species present in the park include Menelik’s Bushbuck, Spotted Hyena, Klipspringer, Leopard, Rock Hyrax, Olive Baboon, Hamadryas Baboon, Vervet Monkey, and many others.</p>

              <h5>Ethiopian Wolf</h5>
              <img class="section-image right wildlife" ng-src="{{$root.saCDNURL}}About-TSM-Wildlife-Wolf.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="first-paragraph">The Ethiopian Wolf is one of the rarest Canids in the world, and is native to the Ethiopian highlands. It is distinguished by its low and narrow skull, and its red and white fur, and is similar in size to a coyote. The Ethiopian Wolf is highly specialized to feed on Afroalpine rodents, and is Africa’s most endangered carnivore with an estimated population of 350-450 individuals.</p>
              <p>The Ethiopian wolf is a social animal, with groups containing up to 20 individuals. Each pack has a well-established hierarchy, and these packs typically occupy communal territories of approximately 2 square miles or more, depending on rodent density. Ethiopian Wolves tend to hunt during the day, when rodents are most active, and typically feed only on small prey. In a 1902 book chronicling his travels through the Simien mountains, Major Percy-Cotton described the hunting behaviour of Ethiopian Wolves as thus:</p>
              <blockquote>... they are most amusing to watch, when hunting. The rats, which are brown, with short tails, live in big colonies and dart from burrow to burrow, while the cuberow (Ethiopian Wolf) stands motionless till one of them shows, when he makes a pounce for it. If he is unsuccessful, he seems to lose his temper, and starts digging violently; but this is only lost labour, as the ground is honeycombed with holes, and every rat is yards away before he has thrown up a pawful”</blockquote>

              <h5>Birds</h5>
              <img class="section-image right wildlife" ng-src="{{$root.saCDNURL}}About-TSM-Wildlife-Birds.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="first-paragraph">Nearly 200 species of birds have been found in the Simien Mountains National Park, with 5 species endemic to Ethiopia and an additional 12 species endemic to Ethiopia and Eritrea. Among the unique species found in the park are the red-billed chough, of which a small population live on the Gich plateau, as well as the Abyssinian Catbird, Spot-breasted Plover, Abyssinian Longclaw, Ankober Serin, and more.</p>
              <p>The park is particularly rich in vultures and raptors. One striking example is the bearded vulture, which is an enormous bird with a wingspan over 2 meters, commonly seen soaring high along the cliffs. The bearded vulture waits patiently for scavengers to finish picking off meat, and then descends to retrieve whole bones. These vultures can then be seen diving towards the cliffs, bone in beak, at speeds up to 130 km/hr. Just before reaching the cliffs, the vulture will release the bone, causing it to strike the rock at a very fast speed and shatter. The vultures then swallow the bone shards whole - this is the only animal that feeds almost exclusively on bone, with bone comprising 70-90% of the diet.</p>
